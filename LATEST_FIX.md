# 🔧 Latest Fix - Additional Information Section Removed

## Issue Fixed ✅

### Problem
When uploading a dataset, an "Additional Information" section was appearing in the **Current Air Quality** card showing:
- Country: Vietnam
- Status: Good

This was confusing because:
1. It appeared in the wrong place (Current Air Quality card)
2. It showed metadata that should be in the Country-wise Analysis section
3. It disappeared later, causing inconsistency
4. It cluttered the main status display

### Solution
**Removed the "Additional Information" section entirely** from the Current Air Quality card.

### What Changed

**File**: `app.js`

**Changes**:
1. Removed the conditional display of extra metadata in `updateCurrentStatus()` function
2. Now always hides the extra metadata element
3. Commented out the `displayExtraMetadata()` function

**Code Before**:
```javascript
// Show extra metadata if available
if (state.activeDataset === 'uploaded' && latestData.metadata) {
    displayExtraMetadata(latestData.metadata);
} else {
    elements.extraMetadata.style.display = 'none';
}
```

**Code After**:
```javascript
// Hide extra metadata - country info shown in Country-wise Analysis section instead
elements.extraMetadata.style.display = 'none';
```

### Result

**Current Air Quality card now shows**:
- ✅ AQI value (large number)
- ✅ AQI category (Good, Moderate, etc.)
- ✅ PM2.5 value
- ✅ Last updated timestamp
- ❌ NO "Additional Information" section

**Country-specific data is shown in**:
- ✅ **Country-wise Air Quality Analysis** section (appears when uploading datasets with country column)
- Shows proper country comparison with charts
- More organized and meaningful presentation

## Benefits

2. **No Confusion**: Country info appears only in the dedicated Country-wise Analysis section
3. **Consistency**: No disappearing sections
4. **Better UX**: Information is where users expect it
