## 📈 ROI Impact Calculator

### How It Works

The interactive ROI calculator allows stakeholders to estimate the financial impact of implementing the AQI forecasting system.

### Input Parameters

1. **Population Affected**: Number of people in the coverage area
   - Default: 100,000
   - Range: 1,000 - 10,000,000+

2. **Avg Healthcare Cost/Person**: Average cost per pollution-related health incident
   - Default: $50
   - Range: $10 - $1,000+
   - Includes: ER visits, medications, lost productivity

3. **Prevention Rate**: Percentage of incidents preventable with forecasting
   - Default: 15%
   - Range: 1% - 100%
   - Based on: Early warnings, behavioral changes, protective measures

### Output Metrics

1. **Annual Healthcare Savings**
   - Total estimated savings from prevented health incidents
   - Formula: `(Population × Prevention Rate × Incident Rate × Healthcare Cost)`

2. **Prevented Health Incidents**
   - Number of health incidents avoided annually
   - Direct measure of public health impact

3. **ROI Multiple**
   - Return on investment compared to implementation cost
   - Formula: `Annual Savings / Implementation Cost ($50,000)`
   - Example: 15x ROI means $15 saved for every $1 invested

### Example Calculation

**Inputs**:
- Population: 100,000
- Healthcare Cost: $50/person
- Prevention Rate: 15%

**Outputs**:
- Annual Savings: **$750,000**
- Prevented Incidents: **15,000**
- ROI Multiple: **15x**

**Interpretation**: For every $1 invested in the forecasting system, the community saves $15 in healthcare costs.
